                  <p>Welcome Trainer, 
                    You are about to start a great adventure, but your path is full of pitfalls !
                    Luckily, your pokémon friends are here to help.

                    Select a destination on your map and battle trainers to clear your way through glory !
                    Victories might also reward you with new friends and more...

                    Your pokémons have many abilities, different types and strengths/weaknesses.
                    It is up to you to figure out the best team configuration to win each battle.
